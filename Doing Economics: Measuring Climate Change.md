# Week 1

## Introduction to Climate Change

Many scientists now see climate change as the greatest threat to future human wellbeing. This problem has five particular features that make it especially challenging:

* _Stabilizing yearly emissions is not sufficient_: Climate is affected by the stock (total amount) of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Merely stabilizing the amount of emissions we release into the atmosphere each year will not be enough to tackle climate change, because we are still adding to the stock of greenhouse gases.
* _Irreversibility of climate change_: The CO2 we emit today can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, which means that our current actions have long-lasting effects on future generations.
* _The worst-case scenario_: Experts are uncertain about the scale, timing, and global pattern of climate change's effects, but 
most agree that climate change could be catastrophic. Therefore, policymakers need to take into account a range of possible scenarios and not just the most likely scenario, including some very unlikely but disastrous ones.
* _A global problem requiring international cooperation_: The contributions to climate change come from all parts of the world, and its effects will also be felt globally. It will be solved only by a high level of cooperation between the largest and most powerful nations (at a minimum), on a scale without historical precedent.
* _Conflicts of interest_: The impacts of climate change differ among people according to their economic circumstances, both across the globe and within countries. Future generations will experience the effects of today’s emissions, but also the actions we take to reduce them. It is unclear how to balance the competing interests of individuals in different economic circumstances, and the interests of current and future generations.

### Climate change and economic activity

The figure below shows the data on the stock of CO2 (in parts per million) using the right-hand scale, and global temperature (as the deviation from the 1961-1990 average) using the left-hand scale, for the years 1750-2000.

The figure above illustrates a key fact of climate science: that global warming is an effect of the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels for power generation and industrial use leads to emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. These activities, together with CO2 emissions from land-use changes, generate greenhouse gases equivalent to around 36 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. 

Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased from 280 parts per million in 1800 to 400 parts per million, currently rising at 2–3 parts per million each year. CO2 allows incoming sunlight to pass through it, but traps reflected heat on the earth, leading to increases in atmospheric temperatures and changes in climate. Some CO2 also gets absorbed into the oceans, which increases ocean acidity and kills marine life.

The figure below presents a "bathtub model" to illustrate why continual CO2 emissions is a problem. Climate change is caused by the stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases, not by the flow of our annual emissions. It’s what’s in the tub that matters.

### Limiting climate change by reducing CO2 emissions 

It is estimated that we can emit only a further 1 to 1.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere to give reasonable odds of limiting the increase in temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Should we manage to achieve this limit on emissions, there is still a probability of around 1% that temperature increases would be more than 6°C, causing a global economic catastrophe. 

If we exceed the limit and temperature rises to 3.4°C above pre-industrial levels, the probability of a climate-induced economic catastrophe would rise to 10%.

To support this objective, the IPCC published a special report in 2018, according to which global warming in excess of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would mean a significant increase in temporary and permanent damage to people, species and ecosystems.

Follow this link to view a figure that shows the relationship between estimated temperature increases and CO2 emitted. It also shows the amount of CO2 that would be emitted if we:
* burnt the fossil fuels that can be economically extracted at current prices and technology (reserves)
* burnt all fossil fuels in the earth’s crust (resources)

The figure indicates that keeping the warming to 2°C implies that the majority of fossil fuel reserves and resources should remain in the ground.

## Predicted and potential effects of climate change on lifestyles and the economy

The reality of climate change is now widely accepted in the scientific community. The likely consequences of global warming are far-reaching: melting of the polar ice caps, rising sea levels that may put large coastal areas under water, and potential changes in climate and rain patterns that may destroy the world’s food-growing areas.    

Climate change is a global phenomenon. But many of the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels are local, as residents of cities suffer respiratory and other illnesses as a result of high levels of harmful emissions from power plants, vehicles, and other sources. Rural communities, too, are impacted by deforestation (another cause of climate change) and the depletion of the supply of clean water and fishing stocks.

In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
released a report that summarises the current and future effects of climate change on lifestyles and livelihoods around the world, which include:

* _Crop yields_. Climate change can affect crops such as wheat are sensitive to weather patterns. Variations in weather caused by climate change can make crop yields unpredictable, which in turn affects food prices, food security, and diet quality. For example, the 2006-2010 droughts in northeast Syria reduced crop yields by 32-79% and killed 85% of herders’ livestock. 
* _Heat-related mortality_. In recent decades, over one-third of heat-related deaths can be attributed to climate change. This percentage is expected to increase as heatwaves become more frequent. 
* _Incidence of vector-borne diseases_. The warming climate means that tropical species can now survive in regions that were previously too cold for them. In those areas there has been an accompanying increase in the diseases that these species transmit. Examples include epidemic outbreaks of malaria in the highland areas of Africa and South America, and the 2018 West Nile fever outbreak in Southern Europe.

The economic impacts of climate change are also likely to be severe. The IPCC predicts that if global average temperatures rise by 4C (the “business as usual” scenario), global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2100 will be 10-23% lower than it would be if no warming occurred. For reference, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced global GDP by around 3%, and the 2008 financial crisis reduced global GDP by around 5%. (To learn more about GDP and what it measures, read Section 1.2 of The Economy textbook.)

However, developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change and will be affected more severely. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 62% of the population are currently employed in agriculture - a sector that is particularly affected climate change - and GDP in that region is predicted to be 80% lower in 2100 compared to the no-warming scenario. Climate change will therefore increase inequality between countries (developing vs developed). Climate change will also increase inequality within countries, as lower-income groups are more exposed to extreme weather events relative to higher-income groups. For example, in the US, economic damages as a share of incomes in 2100 are expected to be 9 times larger in the poorest 5% of counties compared to the richest 5%.

## Measuring temperature changes over long time periods

This week, we will be using temperature data from NASA to investigate how temperatures have changed over the past 150 years. 

To measure and report temperature data, NASA uses a different method than your local weather station. The temperature data you usually see in the news is reported in absolute values (degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit), and is measured by reading a thermometer at a nearby weather station, typically located at an airport or city centre. This number is a measurement from one location at one point in time, which is useful for communicating current local weather conditions, but less useful for observing longer-run trends in temperature over broader regions. 

Instead of absolute temperatures, NASA uses relative temperatures (“temperature anomalies”). Temperature anomalies tell us how much warmer or colder a particular place is compared to its “normal” temperature in that month. “Normal” is defined as the average temperature in that month over the period 1951-1980. Positive numbers indicate temperatures that are higher than average, and negative numbers indicate temperatures that are lower than average. For example, the temperature anomaly in the Northern Hemisphere in June 2021 was 1.21, meaning that it was 1.21 degrees warmer compared to June in 1951-1980. 

Temperature anomalies are a useful measure of regional or global temperatures because:

* They are more representative of a wider area than absolute temperatures. Absolute temperature can vary greatly within a region. For example, the temperature at the top of a mountain will be much lower than the temperature at the bottom of that mountain, so the average temperature may not be very meaningful. To assess how temperatures in that mountain area have changed over time, taking the average of the temperature changes (average change at the top of the mountain and average change at the bottom of the mountain) gives a more accurate measure than taking the average temperature at the top and the bottom.
* They allow us to reliably compare temperature changes over time. Researchers have encountered problems when trying to assess how absolute temperatures have changed over time, because their conclusions depended on the baseline temperature chosen (the long-run average absolute temperature). The recommended baseline temperature to use changes over time according to further research – for example, before 2000, the baseline temperature commonly used was 15 degrees Celsius, but it changed to 14 degrees Celsius after 2000. These changes in baseline temperature make it difficult to compare absolute temperatures across time. In contrast, when using anomalies, there is nothing special about NASA’s choice of 1951-1980 as the base period. Using any other base period would give the same conclusions about temperature changes over time.
